"""ALADYN — Automated Library for Advanced DYNamics.

3D rigid multibody simulation with Euler-parameter orientation and
absolute-coordinate DAE formulation (Shabana, *Computational Dynamics*).

The public façade exposes the top-level model class plus the most commonly
used model entities. Subpackages can also be imported directly when finer
granularity is needed.

See ``ARCHITECTURE.md`` at the repository root for design decisions and
import-graph rules.

# Re-exports will be added module-by-module as implementations land.
